# Hello Parrot
Hello Parrot is a web application initially created for my students to be able to practice their English speaking and writing skills daily. This app was an idea I had to supplement the learning material already accessible to my students *Just more practical this time* My reasoning behind the web app was: leaning is not just theoretical it is 90% practical- I intended to bring the practicality of language learning throught this app.

**Link to project:** no live anymore. under construction! ( coming soon)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, PassportJs, ExpressJS and MongoDB

## Optimizations

Hello Parrot was only used in the classroom as a test run however there is alot of work that still needs to be done. I kept running into issues especially with my Routes. I have taken the steps to borrow other set of eyes to help me resolve the issue (currently happening as i write this). I have also had problems getting the video recording volme working after a student has recorded their daily speaking challenge 



## Lessons Learned:

Documentation is king! I have had to learn more about the different libraries that I have included in the app such as ExpressLayouts! I had never used it before and figuring out why I was getting errors related to Layout was the biggest challenge although layouts are meant to be straight forward unfortunately this time it wasnt. Another lesson learned has to be ** the ability to ask help** as a developer I had figured I could only ask for help with complicated issues, layouts shouldnt be complicated come on!! helllooo I had been dealing with the issue for a couple of days clearly I needed help. I have learned to seek help and to learn to ask questions in such a way that it helpful to those who I am asking help from..  what i am saying is team work makes the dream work!
